## Q. But sir, What is N3RD?

🤓 N3RD is a protocol,
🤓 N3RD is a community,
🤓 N3RD is an economy,
🤓 N3RD is a culture!

## Q. Still no idea… Can you give a traditional explanation, sir?

🤓: Sure, it’s a DeFi protocol that’s currently being built on Ethereum. It is also a deflationary Cryptocurrency featuring deflationary farming!
In time, there will be a full suite of DeFi products combined with automated yield generating strategies. A DAO maintained and governed by the community!

## Key areas of R&D :

- Meta Vault (a safe and simple, way to farm)
- Borrowing/Lending
- Saving
- Arbitrage
- Gaming
- NFTs
- Decentralised margin (cherry on the cake) …

All in all, we will slowly and safely roll out value-added services that give more and more utility to the \$NERDz token.

## Q. Okay, but can you give a degen explanation sir ?

🤓 : Sure,
✅ Deflationary farming
✅ 21,000 NERDz fixed Total supply
✅ 50 % of the rewards  locked for 1 month 🚀
✅ Pumpamentals
✅ Devs are dead
✅ Unruggable
✅ “CORE on steriods”²
✅ #Defi #NFT #DAO

## Q.How do I participate, sir…? MMMuh Familia…

🤓: If you don’t fully understand the code , don’t participate!

#Q.But still…. I want to Ape in ?
🤓: Ok, look, only a true N3RD can take part in our Liquidity Generation Event.
You have to complete a game level in order to be one of the Lucky whitelisted degens !!!
That’s right, we have built a fun game just for the launch of the project… Because why not? : )

🚼FAQ

## Q. Is this a CORE clone?

—  No, its not a clone, its a highly modified fork.
We took the original CORE code and forked it to our liking. Same with the token economics. We are laying down a safe and strong foundation that we can build on top.
However we have some key differences and we can move fast, very fast! So we believe there will be a lot of farmers who prefer N3RD.

## Q. Does that mean N3RD.FINANCE will have a similar “roadmap”/development?

-Yes and no 🤓. We are pretty capable of implementing any of the hottest innovations we see in the space, however, everything will be filtered and adjusted to our vision and discussed with the N3RD community.

## Q. Who is Nerd GOD? (the dev)

-To avoid unnecessary speculations, the identity of Nerd God will stay hidden. Let’s just say he is a seasoned senior dev and an absolute N3RD🤓.

- Nerd God rarely talks human language.
- Nerd God not only write code, but he also drinks and eats code!
- We are N3RD finance!
- In GOD we trust - > In CODE we trust! 🙌🤓

## Q. Wen security audit?

We have done a lot of testing and continue to do so. Right after the LGE, we will reach out to the Arcadia team regarding our first Official audit. As we continue to develop we will engage different companies and individuals to do more audits.
